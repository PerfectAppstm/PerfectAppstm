# DTDL3+ - Daily To-Do List Plus

This repository contains an early prototype of **DTDL3+**, a multi-platform task manager. The goal is to collect all of your planning information in one place and generate daily schedules with the help of AI.

## Features

* **Broiling Pot** â€“ submit your vision, projects, tasks and more to build your agenda.
* **Sidebar navigation** for quick access to views such as Daily Tasks, Weekly Look and Project Progress.
* **Simple form handling** with JavaScript that prints your submitted data.

This initial version only provides a static web interface, but it lays the groundwork for future expansion into a full offline-first web app that syncs across devices.

## Running the App

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. No build steps or server setup are required.

Feel free to fork the project and help expand its functionality!
